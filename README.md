# 42 Core Curriculum Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of projects from the **42 School Core Curriculum**.
This repository contains C and C++ projects ranging from low-level programming to multi-threading, graphics, and web servers.

Each project is located in its own subdirectory with source code and documentation.
